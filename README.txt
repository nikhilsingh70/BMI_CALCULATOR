Overview
The BMI Calculator project is a simple Python application designed to compute and classify an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This project helps beginners practice basic programming concepts, input handling, and conditional statements.

Objectives
Develop a Python program to calculate BMI.
Practice input/output operations and conditional logic.
Classify BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.
Features
User Input:

Enter weight (kg) and height (m).
BMI Calculation:

Formula: 
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 
BMI Classification:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
Output:

Display BMI value and health classification.
Optional Features
Unit conversion (pounds/inches to kg/m).
Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter or PyQt.
Health recommendations based on BMI.
Input validation for numerical correctness.
